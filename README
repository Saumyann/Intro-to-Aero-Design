The code calculates the thrust, drag, and acceleration at certain time intervals throughout the rocket flight. 
The code uses a software called NASA CEA to calculate certain aspects of the fuel chose (APCP-composite). 
These parameters are then used to calculate the flight parameters for the rocket.
